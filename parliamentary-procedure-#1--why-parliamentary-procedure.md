## Parliamentary Procedure part 1: Why Parliamentary Procedure?

I want to share a few thoughts I think will be helpful in your understanding why we use parliamentary procedure.

First, we want to realize that from the beginning the Seventh-day Adventist Church has followed a representative form of church governance. This was not an arbitrary choice. Several of our pioneer members had been cast out of other churches which were controlled by clergy. They saw that too often clergy, that is, pastors and bishops or administrative leadership over pastors, controlled congregations and that when it came to issues of present truth, the forces of evil found it less difficult to work through a smaller number of men they could influence. The ultiamte example of this approiach is the papacy, with its smal lnbumber of cardinals and its single pope and the enormous powers vested in him. If Satan can control the pope and cardinals, he has an enormous control over that Church, which he does.

In contrast to limiting power and uathority to a very small number of men, our pioneers came out of an essentially Protestant background. So from the beginning they doubted the authority of councils and of tradition. They looked to the Bible and the menof God, the elders of the churches, whose lives were shaped by it.

They also came out of the enlightenment background which had considerable confidence in God's gift of reason to humans. While the enlightenment in France was heavily humanistic, the enlightenment in Scotland was very Christian. Our spiritual ancestors believed that God directly communed with every believer. The pastor and the elder were not priests with special powers, but fellow Christians who put on their socks one foot at a time just like the regular members of the church. Rather than trusting the experience of one man, they sought to check the ascendancy of the individual clergyman by distributing authority in the church to all of its members. They would respect the pastor, the elder, but they would beware the risks of trusting in one frail human vessel.

Today it is common to think in terms of our "rights" as members. You and I have "rights." And we can think of it that way, but I am less sure that we have many particular rights. What I am sure of is that as church members, you and I bear many responsibilities and we are given many privileges. And so I am going to speak to you not about rights but about these issues of trust, these things God trusts us with: responsibilites and privielges.

Every church member then has responsibilities and privileges. And in a congregation, there are groups and individuals both. Parliamentary procedure is designed to protect and encourage us, as church members, to be faithful in fulfilling our responsibilities and in exercising our privileges for the good of the body. They are given us to build up the church.

In a congregation there are, as we said, not only individuals but groups. Parliamentary procedure is useful then to protect these resposnibilites and privileges of the majority, the minority, the individual member, and of those members who are absent.

* OF THE MAJORITY

We protect the rights of the majority because we believe in regenerate church membership. that is, we expect that members are converted, and that if a congregation is spritually healthy, the majority of the members will seek to be discovering and responsib=ve toward God's will. While we have good reason to expect this, there is never a guarantee that the majority will be right, in the world or in the Church. Neverthless, we exercise humilit and submit to the decision of the majority.

* OF THE STRONG MINORITY

In a voluntary organization like the church, a strong minority might not be very much less than the majority. It might be nearly half of the group. We should very much respect the them. Remember, they can all take their marbles and leave at any time. We want to retain their good will and we value them.

* OF THE MINORITY

History will remind us of many times when a very small number of persons actually had a correct opinion on a matter. Noah was in the minority. So was Gideon. So was Moses, and how many other prophets? There are occasions in Adventist history when only one person on a committee objected but that person had the correct view.

Tyranny by minority over the majority is barred, but so is tyranny of the majority against minorities.

a defining characteristic of democracy must be the people's right to change the majority through elections. This right is the people's "supreme authority." The minority, therefore, must have the right to seek to become the majority and possess all the rights necessary to compete fairly in elections—speech, assembly, association, petition—since otherwise the majority would make itself permanent and become a dictatorship. For the majority, ensuring the minority's rights becomes a matter of self-interest, since it must utilize the same rights when it is in minority to seek to become a majority again. This holds equally true in a multiparty parliamentary democracy, where no party has a majority, since a government must still be formed in coalition by a majority of parliament members.

"It is of great importance in a republic, not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part."

the minority's rights must be protected no matter how singular or alienated that minority is from the majority society; otherwise, the majority's rights lose their meaning.

In America citizen's "rights" are guaranteed through the Constitution. In the Church, a members responsibilities and privileges are safeguarded through agreed upon procedures.


The practices that we follow are in place to carefully balance the rights of the persons and subgroups within the congregation's total membership

individual members
absentees

The member who is absent also has rights. He may be traveling or in the hospital or for some other reason is not present, but he is a member of the community. While the absent member is not granted the privielge of voting, the fact that he is a member means he should be given sufficient notice before  ameeting that he would normally have opportunity to attend and participate. The leadership has the responsibility to see to it that members are given satisfactory notice of an upcoming meeting and of the issues to be addressed in that meeting.

expressing its general will through the assembly of its members

esablish a leadership as it wishes

reserve control to itself (larger assembly like business meeting)

majority decide the general will, but only after opportunity for a deliberative process and free discussion


 each individual has a right to make the maximum effort declared the will of the assembly as far as the entire body can tolerate it

protection against instability, requirements to change a previous action are greater than in the first place

church board - resonsibilities and powers delegated to it

voluntary


rights or privileges or capabilities?
