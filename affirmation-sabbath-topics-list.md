### 1. How God has Led Us

God led in the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Thousands responded to Heaven's call to proclaim the nearness of Jesus' return, yet few studied and embraced the Biblical truths needful for this hour. Learn how God's Church today is a world church called to unite together in a world wide work.

### 2. What is Protestant Biblical Interpretation?

How the Adventist approach to interpreting the Bible differs from other churches. Why Scripture must interpret Scripture. Help listeners be able to identify subtle methods of interpretation which are presently seeking entrance to the Church.

### 3. Truths We Must Share

Why Jesus calls the Seventh-day Adventist Church to deliver unique, even unpopular truths to the world including the Sabbath, the Sanctuary, and the state of the dead.

### 4. Messenger to the Remnant

What truths could be so important that God would confirm them to His people by sending a prophetess? Why provoke inevitable controversy by appointing a prophet as part of Heaven's guidance to us? How Heaven's guidance through Ellen G. White can strengthen God's Church.

### 5. A Missionary Work

As a world church Adventists send missionaries all over the globe. How our faithfulness in mission work boomerangs back and helps our own congregations be faithful in living the mission.

### 6. Education and Church Growth

We are a world church. How the education of our youth and our worldwide education system (second in size only the Catholic) strengthens worldwide mission.

### 7. Medical Work and the Growth of the Gospel

We are a world church. Worldwide church growth through medical work.

### 8. UCC Regions and You

Understand how UCC delegates are chosen. Explain the five regions, the large committee, and the nominating committee process.

### 9. Making the Representative System Work

Help your local church be faithful. How to select delegates and officers for the Constituency and Lay-advisory committees. Be ahead of rather than behind the curve. Make yourself available.

### 10. Laypeople and Representative Governance

Explain basics of representation at the Conference level, along with the member's role in local church and Conference committees.

### 11. Rights of Members

Understand member's rights to open board meetings, business meeting participation, and proper process in the selection of local church officers.

### 12. How the Church Works

How the church works, from the local member to the General Conference. Jesus is the Head of the body, meaning the local church, its board, the conference executive committee, and union and division committees.

### 13. Parliamentary Procedure #1: Why Parliamentary Procedure?\*

Basic principles of member's rights: the majority, minority, individual members, and absentees.

### 14. Parliamentary Procedure #2: Main Motion\*

What delegates and committee members need to know about how the main motion works: the differences between original and incidental motions, and main motions that are not in order.

### 15. Parliamentary Procedure #3: Secondary Motions\*

Postpone, Amend, Refer, Limit Debate, Previous Question, etc.

### 16. Parliamentary Procedure #4: Point of Order\*

When a point of order is valid, and if necessary, how to challenge the ruling of the chair.

### 17. Conference Constitution and Bylaws

Current UCC Constitution and Bylaws and needed amendments.

### 18. We Are the World Church

The world church is not the administrators. Why you, the local members, effectively play a much more determinative role in the Church than Conference, Union, and Division leadership.

### 19. Non-unity to Unity: How?

Why God's church can come into unity, not through mere informational knowledge, but through clear-thinking members involved in representative processes.

### 20. How to Be a Help to Your Pastor

Be involved in a humble and helpful way so as to help your pastor carry out his proper duties and not exceed his authorities. Help him plan for needed duties (nominating committee, delegate selection, etc.).
