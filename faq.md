# (FAQ) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## What is World Church Affirmation Sabbath? (Concise)

World Church Affirmation Sabbath is a regional gathering of laypeople in a Conference to build up the Church. Laypeople gather and fellowship together while participating in short, interactive lay-presented talks designed to equip to bless the Conference. Meetings uplift Christ, support the world church, and oppose insubordinate Conference, Union, and Division agendas

## What is World Church Affirmation Sabbath? (Detail)

World Church Affirmation Sabbath is an event held in Conferences on an approximately quarterly basis for equipping, fellowship, and encouragement. Affirmation Sabbath is a lay-led means of edifying the Church. The Church should be more movement than institution, but it can prosper as a movement only as laypersons help leaders be accountable. If there is a disconnect between how our faith is acted out in our pulpits and deeds of mercy, and in our local church and our Conference committees, something is broken. Following Jesus amidst the deceptions of the last days requires that those who lead be doctrinally sound and supportive of the world church body. Good intentions are no sufficient qualification. A special experience awaits a faithful Church (Revelation 2:2-3).

Although we would prefer that it not be so, many of today's challenges for our Church concern the Present Truth found summarized in the Sanctuary. This being true, shall we not preach, teach, write, and act with clarity and boldness?

## What if My Conference Leaders Oppose Affirmation Sabbath?

Some may oppose it, but look at the key values of Affirmation Sabbath. If Conference leaders oppose it, it may be that it is especially needed in your Conference! Fortunately, World Church Affirmation Sabbath is lay-led by *design*; it is not *intended* to be led by Conference officers. Arrange meetings with faithful church members at a local church in your part of the Conference where the pastor supports the world church. Everything starts small. Affirmation Sabbath could be the catalyst for long needed revival and reformation your Conference has been waiting for. What do you have to lose?

## Is this Initiative Anti-Conference?

Some have reacted to unfaithful leadership by taking an anti-conference stance and withdrawing from the Church. Our approach is to seek to build up the Conference by becoming not less but more involved. We are completely supportive of the world church. We staunchly oppose separation. All participants in WCASCLUCC are respected members in Upper Columbia Conference churches, and most serve as church officers in their local congregations.

## How Did World Church Affirmation Sabbath Begin?

It has its origins in conversations which arose between members of the Upper Columbia Conference Lay-Advisory Committee in March 2016, in the context of
disregard by some North American Division church leaders for the voted decisions of the General Conference in Session.

## Who Is Behind World Church Affirmation Sabbath?

The **World Church Affirmation Sabbath Committee of Laypeople of the Upper Columbia Conference** (**WCASC** for short) is composed of laypersons who are members in regular standing in Upper Columbia Conference churches and who support the Seventh-day Adventist world church. In Upper Columbia Conference, Affirmation Sabbath meetings are voted by church boards and held by local churches in liason with WCASC.

## How Can We Introduce World Church Affirmation Sabbaths in our Conference?

Contact us! We can help you get started. Everything begins with one step. We have resources and experience and will be glad to help.

## How Important is it for Laypeople to Network with Each Other?

It has been our experience that those who are moving in contradiction to God's plan for His Church tend to be well known to each other. Consequently, they are often appointed to important committees, and to make decisions differing from what is best for this time. Because the Adventist system of church governance is unambiguously representative, it is extremely important that those who are converted to Jesus and who love Present Truth and who have doctrinal clarity and who are capable leaders, become known to Conference membership. Their gifts are given to be a blessing to the Conference. This outcome becomes more likely as faithful members are networked with each other.
