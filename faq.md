# (FAQ) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## How Did World Church Affirmation Sabbath Begin?

Its origins are found in conversations that arose between members of the Upper Columbia Conference Lay-Advisory Committee in March 2016, in the context of disregard by some North American Division church leaders for the voted decisions of the 2015 General Conference in Session.

## Who Is Behind World Church Affirmation Sabbath?

The **World Church Affirmation Sabbath Committee of Laypeople of the Upper Columbia Conference** (**WCASC** for short) is composed of laypersons who are members in regular standing in Upper Columbia Conference churches and who support the Seventh-day Adventist world church. In Upper Columbia Conference, Affirmation Sabbath meetings are voted by church boards and held by local churches in liason with WCASC.

## What is World Church Affirmation Sabbath? (Concise)

World Church Affirmation Sabbath is

* a gathering of laypeople
* by region within a Conference

to build up the Church. Laypeople combine in fellowship and participate in brief, interactive lay-presented talks designed to equip to bless the Conference. Meetings uplift Christ and support the world church.

## What is World Church Affirmation Sabbath? (Detail)

World Church Affirmation Sabbath is an event held in Conferences on an approximately quarterly basis for equipping, fellowship, and encouragement. Affirmation Sabbath is a lay-led means of edifying the Church. The Church remains effective as a movement only as laypersons help leaders be accountable. There should be no disconnect between that faith acted out in the pulpits of faithful churches and in what is decided in our Conference committees. As the Church follows Jesus through the closing days of Earth's history, those who lead need to be doctrinally sound and supportive of the world church body. Good intentions are no sufficient qualification. A special experience awaits a faithful Church (Revelation 2:2-3).

## How Can We Introduce World Church Affirmation Sabbaths in our Conference?

Contact us! We can help you get started. Everything begins with one step. We have resources and experience and will be glad to help.

## What if My Conference Leaders Oppose Affirmation Sabbath?

Fortunately, World Church Affirmation Sabbath is lay-led by *design*; it is not *intended* to be led by Conference officers. Consider making arrangements to hold World Church Affirmation Sabbath with faithful church members at a local church in your part of your Conference where the pastor supports the world church. Affirmation Sabbath could be the catalyst for long needed revival and reformation for which your Conference has been waiting.

## Is this Initiative Anti-Conference?

Some have reacted to wrong-direction leadership by taking an anti-conference stance and withdrawing from the Church. In contrast, our approach seeks to build up the Conference by becoming not less but more involved. We are completely supportive of the world church. We staunchly oppose separation. All participants in WCASCLUCC are respected members in Upper Columbia Conference churches, and most serve as church officers in their local congregations.

## How Important is it for Laypeople to Network with Each Other?

It has been our experience that those who are moving in contradiction to God's plan for His Church tend to be well known to each other. Because they are so well networked, they are often appointed to important committees where they make decisions which are not best for this time. Because the Adventist system of church governance is representative, it is extremely important that those in your Conference who are converted to Jesus and who love Present Truth and who have doctrinal clarity and who are capable leaders, become known to your Conference membership. Their gifts are given to be a blessing to the work of the Conference. Their increased service to Jesus in your Conference becomes more likely as faithful members are networked with each other.
