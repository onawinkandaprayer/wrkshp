## 1. How God has Led Us

God led in the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Thousands responded to Heaven's call to proclaim the nearness of Jesus' return, but few studied and embraced the Biblical truths needful in this hour. How can His Church recover this clarity and act it out?

## 2. Truths We Must Share

Why Heaven calls us to deliver Jesus' unique truths to the world, including the Sabbath, the Sanctuary, and the state of the dead.

## 3. Messenger to the Remnant

What truths could be so important that God would send a prophetess to His people?

## 4. A Missionary Work

Adventists send missionaries all over the globe. Can increased clarity about missionary work help our focus in our Conference?

## 5. Education and Church Growth

How the education of our youth and our worldwide education system (second in size only the Catholic) strengthens worldwide mission.

Worldwide church growth through medical work.

Help members understand the member's rights to open board meetings, business meeting participation, and proper process in the selection of local church officers.

## 11. How the Church Works

How the church works, from the local member to the General Conference. Jesus is the Head of the body, meaning the local church, its board, the conference executive committee, and union and division committees.

## 12. Why Parliamentary Procedure?

Basic principles of member's rights: the majority, minority, individual members, and absentees.

## 13. Basic Parliamentary Motions: Main Motion

What delegates and committee members need to know about how the main motion works: the differences between original and incidental motions, and main motions that are not in order.

Postpone, Amend, Refer, Limit Debate, Previous Question.

## 15. Conference Constitution and Bylaws

Current UCC Constitution and Bylaws and needed amendments.

The world church is not the administrators. Why you, the local members, effectively play a larger role than Conference, Union, and Division leadership.

## 17. Non-unity to Unity: How?

Why God's church can come into unity, not through mere informational knowledge, but through clear-thinking members involved in representative processes.

## 18. How to Be a Help to Your Pastor

Be involved in a humble and helpful way so as to help your pastor carry out his proper duties and not exceed his authorities. Help him plan for needed duties (nominating committee, delegate selection, etc.).
