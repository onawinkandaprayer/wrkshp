## 1. How God has Led Us

God led in the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Thousands responded to Heaven's call to proclaim the nearness of Jesus' return while but few studied and embraced the Biblical truths needful in these last days. How we can recover this clarity and act it out in the Church?

## 2. Truths We Must Share

Why Heaven calls us to deliver Jesus' unique truths to the world, including the Sabbath, the Sanctuary, and the state of the dead.

## 3. Messenger to the Remnant

What truths could be so important that God would send a prophetess to His people?

## 4. A Missionary Work

Adventists send missionaries all over the globe. Can increased clarity about missionary work help our focus in our Conference?

## 5. Education and Church Growth

How education of our youth and our worldwide education system (second in size only the Catholic) has strengthened worldwide mission.

## 6. Medical Work and the Growth of the Gospel

Worldwide church growth through medical work.

## 7. UCC Regions and You

Help members understand how UCC delegates are chosen. Explain five regions, large committee, and nominating committee process.

## 8. Making the Representative System Work

Help your local church be faithful. Selecting delegates and officers for Constituency, lay-advisory, and other meetings. Be ahead of rather than behind the curve. Make yourself available.

## 9. Laypeople and Representative Governance

Explain basics of representation at the Conference level. Your role in local church and Conference committees.

## 10. Rights of Members

Help members understand their rights to open board meetings, business meetings, and proper process in the selection of local church officers.

## 11. How the Church Works

How the church works, from the local member to the General Conference. Jesus is the Head of the body, meaning the local church, its board, the conference executive committee, and union and division committees.

## 12. Why Parliamentary Procedure?

Basic principles of member's rights: the majority, minority, individual members, and absentees.

## 13. Basic Parliamentary Motions: Main Motion

What delegates and committee members need to know about how the main motion works: the differences between original and incidental motions, and main motions that are not in order.

## 14. Basic Pariamentary Motions: Subsidiary Motions

Postpone, Amend, Refer, Limit Debate, Previous Question.

## 15. Conference Constitution and Bylaws

Current UCC Constitution and Bylaws and needed amendments.

## 16. We Are the World Church

The world church is not the administrators. Why you, the local members, effectively trump Conference, Union, and Division leadership.

## 17. Non-unity to Unity: How?

Why God's churchi can come into unity, not through mere informational knowledge of truth, but through clear-thinking members involved in representative processes.

## 18. How to Be a Help to Your Pastor

Be involved in a humble and helpful way so as to help your pastor carry out his proper duties and not exceed his authorities. Help him plan for needed duties (nominating committee, delegate selection, etc).
