# Basic Parliamentary Motions: Main Motion

### What delegates and committee members need to know about how the main motion works: the differences between original and incidental motions, and main motions that are not in order.

---

original main motion

- brings business before the assembly
- introduces a substantive question as a new subject

incidental main motion

- proposes an action specifically defined under parliamentary law
- does not mark the beginning of a particular involvement in a substantive matter
-- further steps in dealing with a substantive matter previously begun
-- deals with procedure, and could even be a call for recess

- wording of a main motion should be concise, unambiguous, and complete
- a motion whose only effect is to propose that the assembly refrain from doing something should not be offered if the same result can be achieved by adopting no motion at all
- motions to reaffirm a position previously taken are out of order
- avoid a motion that contains a negative statement, instead, vote that the congregation "declare its opposition to."
- an original main motion may be offered as a resolution

main motions that are not in order

- no main motion is in order that conflicts with the bylaws, working policy,  or church manual
- no main motion is in order that presents substantially the same question as a motion previously rejected or disposed of during the same session
- nor that proposes an action outside the scope of the organization's object as defined by its bylaws unless 2/3rds vote authorizes


process of handling an original main motion

three steps to bring before the assembly
-1- member makes motion (moves)
-2- another member seconds the motion
-option- may ask maker if he would be willing to change the wording
-option- any member may state a pertinent fact and ask if maker would like to withdraw motion, and maker may withdraw it
-3- the chair states the question (opening the floor for debate)
-option- chair gives maker of the motion first opportunity to speak in debate if he wants it

three steps to consider the motion
-1- members debate the motion
- speaker who wishes to debate must obtain the floor
- each member has right to speak twice on the same question on the same day
- no speaker can exceed the alloted time per speaker
- debate must be confined to the merits of the pending question
- speakers must address their remarks to the chair
- except in small boards and committees, the chair should not enter into discussion of the merits of pending questions
- the presiding officer cannot close debate so long as any member who has not exhausted his right to debate desires the floor, except by order of the assembly (2/3rds vote)
-2- the chair puts the question (puts it to a vote)
- the exact wording used by the chair is definitive
- chair must always call for the affirmative vote before the negative
- chair must always call for the negative vote
-3- chair announces the result of the vote

alternatively, in a routine matter or where there seems to be no opposition, a motion may be adopted by unanimous consent. Chair states "If there is no objection..." If any member objects the chair must state the question
