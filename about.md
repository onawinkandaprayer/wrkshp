The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a Protestant Christian Church of 20 million members serving Jesus in some 220 countries. Adventists accept that the Bible is divinely given by God. He inspired His prophets and the Holy Spirit guided their writing so that the Word of God provides an infallible and authoritative revelation of His will.

Rather than be guided by the whimsical trends of a morally-compromised and secular culture, Adventists follow the teaching of the Bible. The 66 books of the Scriptures, all having the same ultimate author, provide its own interpretation not on the basis of speculations and reconstructions, but from Scripture itself.

Every five years more than 2000 delegates from round the world meet to pray and seek divine guidance for resolving challenges and issues confronting the Church. For example, in San Antonio, TX, USA in 2015 delegates made the Spirit-led decision not to permit the ordination of women to the gospel ministry (1 Timothy 2:9-13; 1 Timothy 3:1-2; Titus 1:5, 6; 1 Corinthians 11:1-3; 14:34, 35; Ephesians 5:22-33; Genesis 2:18-24). This decision applies to the whole global church body. World Church Affirmation Sabbath Committee accepts and supports this decision.
