Seventh-day Adventists are a Protestant Christian Church of 20 million members serving Jesus in 220 countries. Adventists accept that the Bible is divinely given by God. The Holy Spirit inspired and guided their writing so that the Word of God provides an infallible and authoritative revelation of His will.

Rather than be guided by the whimsical trends of a morally-compromised culture, Adventists follow the teaching of Scrupture. The 66 books of the Bible, having the same ultimate author, provide its own interpretation not on the basis of speculation and human reconstructions, but from Scripture itself.

Every five years more than 2000 delegates from round the world meet to pray and seek divine guidance to guide God's Church. For example, in San Antonio, TX, USA, in 2015, delegates made the Spirit-led decision not to permit the ordination of women to the gospel ministry (1 Timothy 2:9-13; 1 Timothy 3:1-2; Titus 1:5, 6; 1 Corinthians 11:1-3; 14:34, 35; Ephesians 5:22-33; Genesis 2:18-24). This decision applies to the whole global church body. World Church Affirmation Sabbath Committee accepts and supports this decision.
